    <h2>Planets</h2>
    <p>
        A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant.The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis,which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. 
        Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called acretion.

    <p>The <b>Solar System</b> has atleast eight planets:
    <ol>
        <li>Mercury</li>
        <li>Venus</li>
        <li>Earth</li>
        <li>Mars</li>
        <li>Jupiter</li>
        <li>Saturn</li>
        <li>Uranus</li>
        <li>Neptune</li>
    </ol>
    These planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole.All planets of the Solar System other than Mercury possess a considerable atmosphere, and some share such features as ice caps,seasons,volcanism,hurricanes,tectonics,and even hydrology.
    Apart from Venus and Mars, the Solar System planets generate magnetic fields, and all except Venus and Mercury have natural satellites . The giant planets bear planetary rings, the most prominent being those of Saturn.

    <h3>Mercury</h3>

    <p>
    Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System.It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere (called an exposphere).
    Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1%of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites.
   </p>
    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\RAMESH\Desktop\venus_resized.jpg" alt="Venus" width="300px" height="250px">
    <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun.It is a rocky planet with the  densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar system, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth.Venus is the third brightest object in Earth's sky.
    </p>
    <h3>Earth</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\RAMESH\Desktop\earth.jpg" alt="Earth" width="300px" height="250px">
    <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
        This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.Earth has a natural satellite called Moon.It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet.
    </p>
    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\RAMESH\Desktop\mars.webp" alt="Mars" width="300px" height="200px">
    <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil,giving it the nickname "The Red Planet".Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide and two irregularly shaped natural satellites:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Phobos</li>
        <li>Deimos</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Jupiter</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\RAMESH\Desktop\jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter" width="300px" height="250px">
    <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the larget in the Solar System.Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times.It was named after Jupiter,the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
    </p>
    <h3>Saturn</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\RAMESH\Desktop\saturn.jpeg" alt="Saturn" width="300px" height="250px">
    <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.It has only one-eight the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
    </p>
     <h3>Uranus</h3>
     <img src="C:\Users\RAMESH\Desktop\uranus.jpg" alt="Uranus" width="300px" height="200px">
     <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a gaseous cyan ice giant.Most of the planet is made out of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritial phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles.
    </p>
     <h3>Neptune</h3>
     <img src="C:\Users\RAMESH\Desktop\neptune.jpg" alt="Neptune" width="300px" height="250px">
     <p>
        Neptune is the eight planet from the Sun and the farthest recognized planet in the Solar System.It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter,the third-most-massive planet,and the densest giant planet.It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
